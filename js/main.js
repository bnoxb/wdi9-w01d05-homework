// 1. const or let = "value"

// 2. variable = 'new definition' - must be a variable declared by using let to be able to change it.

// 3. variable = newVariable

// 4. declare variable is when you first make a variable like: const variableName,  you do not need to give it an initial value.  
//  assign allows you to set a specific value to the variable.  Define a variable refers to assigning a value to a variable during initialization or otherwise.

// 5. Pseudocoding is a strategy to plan out your code by writing down in english step by step logic of what you are going to do.
//  you should do this because it will help you become more efficient and better at coding.

// 6. 70 - 80% of time should be spent planning how you are going to solve a problem.

// Part B
// 1.
